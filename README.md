### 💡Inspiration 💡
Studies have shown that children have suffered learning losses in 4 out of 5 countries, as well as lower income families suffering from an ever growing financial gap. These kids lacked the opportunities that higher income families had access to or were simply isolated by the pandemic. The ByteBrain team sought to provide kids in their highschool education, an alternative learning tool that they could use whenever they needed.

### 🧠What it does🧠
ByteBrain is an education study tool that students can use to study a variety of subjects. Simply launch the app, and pick the subject you want to study. In each subject you can pick the unit and specific chapter you wish to practice. ByteBrain will show you endless word problems related to the chapter. Once you have your answer, input your value into ByteBrain and repeat!

### ⚙️How we built it⚙️
ByteBrain was built using a combination of:
An integrated development environment using java to create the endless question generation algorithm and the overall structure
XML was used to develop the Android app and to merge the question algorithm with the front end

### ⛰️Challenges we ran into⛰️
During our time at GDSC we faced several issues including:
Learning and applying new languages/development tools that we were unfamiliar with. None of us have used android studio before, as well as having little to no knowledge with XML and front-end development.
Merging the products of both subteams turned out to be more time consuming than we had planned, many issues occurred with mismatching versions of Java, IDEs and communication.
During idea creation, we had to limit our scope and vision of our project to be attainable for our technical abilities.

### ✅Accomplishments that we're proud of✅
What we’re proud of:
Learning android studio and developing a working application that displays on our phones.
Dividing responsibilities into sub teams to capitalize on everyone’s strengths
Having funsies :3

### 📚What we learned📚
What we learned working on ByteBrain:
Working in Android Studio
Designing an user interface with XML
Creating an algorithm to generate specific questions
Teamwork and friendship <3

### 🌎What's next for ByteBrain🌎
We have only scratched the surface for the endless possibilities of ByteBrain. We will continue to enhance the generative question algorithm to broaden the range of possible questions. We will add new features such as a login system for students and teachers, add lecture modules to provide a chance for students to learn new concepts as well, create a website linked to the mobile app, add a full solution to the generative question algorithm, and personalized feedback with the use of computer vision. Adding a streak/point system as you complete questions to Our mission: Make learning accessible to all people, regardless of social status, class, or location.
