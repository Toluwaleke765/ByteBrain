# Inspiration: Studies have shown that children have suffered learning losses in 4 out of 5 countries, as well as lower income families suffering from an ever-growing financial gap. These kids lacked the opportunities that higher-income families had access to or were isolated by the pandemic. The ByteBrain team sought to provide kids in their high school education, with an alternative learning tool that they could use whenever they needed.
# ByteBrain was built using a combination of:
# An integrated development environment using Java to create the endless question generation algorithm and the overall structure
# XML was used to develop the Android app and to merge the question algorithm with the front-end
